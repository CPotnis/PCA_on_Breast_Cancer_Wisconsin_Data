# PCA on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data

Applying Principal Component Analysis on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data.

## Installation

This project requires **Python 2.7 or 3+** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:


```bash
jupyter notebook PCA_on_Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.



## Data

Data Set : from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

Attribute Information:
        - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
        - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
        - perimeter
        - area
        - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
        - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
        - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
        - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
        - symmetry 
        - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
